# CO2 emission calculator

A webpage site that returns the amount of CO2-equivalent that will be caused when traveling between two cities using a given transportation method.

## Compilation - How to Compile

As it is a web page, it will not be necessary to compile the program: simply,  you must have internet access (due to the use of open APIs) and use it in your preferred web browser.

The application runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Running the tests

1. Set-up value of the token on field called ORS_TOKEN;
2. Inform the start and end cities on specific fields;
3. Select the transportation-method, using options avaliable;
4. Click on the "Calculate CO2 Equivalent"

## Executing - How to Execute

1. Set-up value of the token on field called ORS_TOKEN;
2. Inform the start and end cities on specific fields;
3. Select the transportation-method, using options avaliable;
4. Click on the "Calculate CO2 Equivalent"
